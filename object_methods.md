# JavaScript Object Methods

This section outlines the Object-related methods and use cases in JavaScript.

| File Name                       | Description                                                                     |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `entries.js`                    | Likely demonstrates how to use `Object.entries()` to get an array of [key, value] pairs. |
| `Object.assign.js`              | Demonstrates how to copy the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. |
| `Object.create.js`              | Shows how to create a new object with the specified prototype object and properties. |
| `Object.defineProperty.js`      | Explains how to define a new property directly on an object, or modify an existing property. |
| `Object.freeze.js`              | Demonstrates how to freeze an object, preventing new properties from being added and existing properties from being removed or modified. |
| `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor.js` | Explains how to get the property descriptor for an own property of an object.      |
| `Object.hasOwnProperty.js`      | Shows how to check if an object has a specific property as its own property (as opposed to inherited). |
| `Object.keys.js`                | Demonstrates how to get an array of a given object's own enumerable property names. |
| `Object.seal.js`                | Explains how to seal an object, preventing new properties from being added and existing properties from being removed. Existing properties can still be modified. |
| `Real_World_Use_Cases.js`      | Provides practical examples of Object usage in JavaScript.                        |

**Notes:**

*   Object methods are crucial for manipulating and working with objects in JavaScript.
*   These methods provide functionalities for creating, modifying, inspecting, and controlling object properties.
